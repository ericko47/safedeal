  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4"><strong>Effective date: May 2025</strong> </p>
    These terms apply to all users of SafeDeal, including buyers, sellers, and visitors. By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please do not use our services.

    <strong>Note:</strong> These terms are subject to change. We recommend reviewing them periodically for any updates.

  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> SafeDeal is not responsible for any transactions that occur outside of our platform. Always ensure you are using our secure escrow system for your transactions.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
    <strong>Warning:</strong> Any fraudulent activities or misrepresentation will result in immediate suspension of your account and possible legal action.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
    <strong>Important:</strong> Always verify the identity of the buyer or seller before completing any transaction. Use our identity verification features to ensure a safe experience.

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">Definitions</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4">
    <li><strong>Escrow:</strong> Funds held securely by SafeDeal until transaction completion.</li>
    <li><strong>Delivery:</strong> Either confirmed receipt through SafeDeal or physical delivery tracked via our platform.</li>
    <li><strong>Premium Seller:</strong> A verified and approved seller authorized to list refurbished or bulk items.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
    <strong>Escrow Fee:</strong> SafeDeal charges a flat escrow fee of 5% on every successful transaction. This fee is deducted from the seller’s payout and is non-refundable once the transaction is completed.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
    <strong>Shipping and Delivery Penalties:</strong> Sellers must ship items within 24 hours of payment confirmation. Delays beyond 24 hours may incur fines of up to 2% of the transaction value. If no shipment is confirmed within 48 hours, SafeDeal will automatically refund the buyer in full.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
    <strong>Buyer Collection Responsibility:</strong> If an item is delivered or arrives at the buyer’s designated location, the buyer must mark it as delivered or collect it within 24 hours. Failure to act within this window may result in fines. After 48 hours, SafeDeal reserves the right to release the funds to the seller.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
    <strong>Refurbished Items:</strong> Only confirmed Premium Sellers may list refurbished items. Listings that violate this policy will be removed.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
    <strong>Second-Hand Goods:</strong> Buy second-hand items at your own risk. SafeDeal does not guarantee quality or authenticity. Always inspect items thoroughly before marking them as delivered.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 mb-2">Payment & Reversals Policy</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
    Payments made through SafeDeal are held in escrow until the buyer confirms delivery or the time window expires. Once funds are released from escrow (to either party), they cannot be reversed by SafeDeal.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
    In cases where a buyer initiates a reversal request before funds are released, SafeDeal may consider it. However, all reversal-related costs, including M-PESA transaction fees, shall be borne by the buyer.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
    If the seller has already received payment, the buyer must initiate contact with Safaricom and the seller directly. SafeDeal will not be liable for funds already released.
