        Q1: How does SafeDeal work?
      </button>
      <div class="px-4 py-2 hidden">
        A: SafeDeal acts as a secure middleman. Buyers send payment to SafeDeal, the seller ships the item, and payment is released once the buyer confirms receipt.

        Q2: How do I pay for an item?
      </button>
      <div class="px-4 py-2 hidden">

        <div class="px-4 py-2 hidden">
